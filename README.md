# Arduino-portfolio
This repository documents my learning journey with Arduino.  Here, I have recorded my initial experiments, challenges, and the progress I made as I learned to work with embedded systems.  It serves as a personal archive of my growth, practical projects, and hands-on experience in electronics and programming.
